    <p>Pongal is a significant Hindu harvest festival primarily celebrated by the Tamil community in South India, marking the end of winter solstice and the beginning of the sun's northward journey, signifying a bountiful harvest and prosperity; the festival is dedicated to the Sun God, Surya, and is characterized by the preparation of a traditional dish called "Pongal," which literally means "to boil over" in Tamil, representing the overflowing abundance of the harvest season; celebrated over multiple days, festivities involve cleaning homes, decorating with rangoli, offering prayers to the Sun, and sharing the special Pongal dish with family and friends.</p>
